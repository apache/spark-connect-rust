# Compatibility

This client aims for **full API parity** with the reference PySpark Spark Connect
client (`pyspark.sql.connect.*`) and the shared modules it depends on. The goal is
that existing Spark Connect code runs unchanged and gets byte-for-byte identical
results. For how this client relates to the `pyspark` and `pyspark-client` packages
on PyPI - and how to tell which one you have installed - see
[Which client am I using?](which-client.md).

## Supported Spark

Apache Spark **4.3.0 and later**. The crate and wheel version tracks the Spark
release it targets (starting at `4.3.0`), so the version number tells you which
Spark it speaks.

## Rust migration for the 4.3 line

`Value` and `LiteralExpression` add a `DayTimeInterval(i64)` variant for signed
microseconds. Downstream exhaustive matches on these public enums must handle
the new variant. Rust interval map keys are stringified as raw microseconds;
Python `timedelta` map keys are not yet supported.

The 4.3 line changes the public Rust representation of expressions and logical
plans to share immutable nodes. This is a breaking change for code that directly
constructs or matches these representations. The `Column` and `DataFrame` APIs,
Python APIs, and Spark Connect protocol are unchanged by this representation change.

`Expression` is now a shared handle; its previous enum variants live in
`ExpressionNode`. Construct an `ExpressionNode` and convert it with `.into()` (or
pass it to `Expression::new`). Match on `expression.node()`, which borrows an
`&ExpressionNode`. Cloning an `Expression` shares its immutable node instead of
recursively copying its children. To change an expression, construct a new node.
Common nodes also have `Expression::literal`, `Expression::column`, and
`Expression::function` constructors.

For example, replace direct `Expression::Literal(...)` construction and matching
with:

```rust
use spark_connect::expression::{Expression, ExpressionNode, LiteralExpression};

let expression: Expression = ExpressionNode::Literal(LiteralExpression::Long(1)).into();
let shared = expression.clone();
match shared.node() {
    ExpressionNode::Literal(LiteralExpression::Long(value)) => assert_eq!(*value, 1),
    _ => panic!("expected a long literal"),
}
```

Child expressions are handles too: `ExpressionNode::DirectShufflePartitionId`
takes an `Expression`, and `CaseWhen::else_expr` is `Option<Expression>`, without
the previous extra `Box`.

Logical-plan child fields now use `Arc<LogicalPlan>` instead of `Box<LogicalPlan>`.
When constructing variants directly, replace `Box::new(child)` with
`Arc::new(child)`, or clone an existing `Arc` to share that child. Plan-building
helpers accept `impl Into<Arc<LogicalPlan>>`, so they accept either an owned
`LogicalPlan` or an existing `Arc<LogicalPlan>`. Serialization still produces the
same protobuf tree; sharing does not deduplicate repeated relations on the wire.

## Native LogisticRegression

The native `spark_connect::ml::LogisticRegression` fits Spark's JVM
`org.apache.spark.ml.classification.LogisticRegression` through the Connect ML
protocol. Training features must be ML vectors; convert an array column with
`array_to_vector` before fitting. This differs from the deprecated Python
`pyspark.ml.connect.classification.LogisticRegression`, which uses array features
and PyTorch training.

Fitting returns a server-cached model. Prediction uses that model's object
reference and must use the same Spark session. Models are obtained through
`Estimator::fit`; direct struct construction of `LogisticRegressionModel` is no
longer supported. The cached model stays available while the model, a clone of
it, or a DataFrame that it transformed is alive, including when such a DataFrame is
executed later. When the last of them is dropped, the cached model is deleted on the
server, as `pyspark.ml` does, without waiting for the server; a fit that is dropped
at once leaves nothing cached.

## Native LinearSVC

`spark_connect::ml::LinearSVC` trains Spark's JVM binary linear support vector
classifier through the Connect ML protocol. Use vector features and labels 0 or 1.
Rust builder setters cover all 13 constructor parameters, including `set_reg_param`,
`set_tol`, `set_weight_col` and `set_threshold`. Unset parameters use Spark's defaults.
The Python binding is available as `pyspark.ml.connect.classification.LinearSVC`
and `pyspark.ml.connect.LinearSVC`, with the upstream keyword-only constructor
parameters and mutating `setFeaturesCol`, `setRegParam`, etc. methods.

`fit` returns a server-cached model; `transform` must use the fitting session.
Clones and lazy prediction DataFrames keep the cached model usable while they are
alive. When the last of the model, its clones and the DataFrames it transformed is
dropped, the server deletes the cached model, as `pyspark.ml` does.
The Python model uses the existing `MLModel.transform` interface. Model inspection
(coefficients, intercept and summaries), single-vector prediction and model
persistence are not exposed by this addition.

## pyspark.ml

The DataFrame-based `pyspark.ml` API (`pyspark.ml.classification`, `feature`,
`regression`, `clustering`, `evaluation`, `tuning`, `stat`, `Pipeline`, ...) is
Apache Spark's own, vendored from v4.3.0: estimators fit, models transform, and
pipelines save and load on the server as with PySpark Connect, over the Rust
transport. These modules build their own `spark.connect` messages with the
generated `pyspark.sql.connect.proto`, which needs the `protobuf` package
(`pip install "protobuf>=6.33.5"`). The package is not a dependency of
`pyspark-client-rust`: without it, `pyspark.ml` imports, but a fit or a transform
raises an `AttributeError` that names `protobuf`.

A DataFrame of a plan of `pyspark.ml` (`DataFrame(plan, session)`) takes the plan ID
of this client rather than the one of the plan, which its columns refer to.

## Spark Declarative Pipelines CLI

The CLI of Spark Declarative Pipelines (`python -m pyspark.pipelines.cli init`, `run` and
`dry-run`) and its modules are Apache Spark's own, vendored from v4.3.0, and Apache Spark's
tests of them pass with this client. The CLI needs `pyyaml` and `protobuf`, which, as for
`pyspark.ml`, are not dependencies of `pyspark-client-rust`. The user context extensions of a
client (`spark.client.add_threadlocal_user_context_extension` and
`add_global_user_context_extension`), which the CLI adds for the analyses of a pipeline, are
sent with the requests of executions, analyses, configurations, error details and interrupts,
as PySpark sends them.

## How parity is verified

Two independent gates in CI cover the two halves of a Spark Connect client - plan
building and the transport/result path:

- **Golden-proto tests** assert that the `spark.connect` protobuf plans this
  client builds (plans, expressions, and every SQL function) match the reference
  client **byte-for-byte**. This guards plan-building correctness.
- **The official Apache Spark Connect test suite** runs the standard PySpark tests
  against this client, exercising the **transport and Arrow result paths**
  end-to-end against a real server. See the official-test-suite notes
  and the CI notes under `dev/design/`.

Together the two gates cover what the client sends and what it does with what
comes back.

## The parity ledger

Coverage is tracked mechanically. `scripts/gen_parity_ledger.py` AST-parses the
reference PySpark source and emits one row per public **class**, **function**, and
**method** into a ledger (`dev/parity/inventory.csv`), so nothing is silently
dropped. The current inventory covers roughly:

| Kind      | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Methods   | ~1340 |
| Functions | ~620  |
| Classes   | ~300  |

Each row carries a status:

- **done** / **verified** - mirrored by the client (and, where applicable,
  confirmed against the reference).
- **n/a** - *architecture-satisfied*: the equivalent wire behavior is provided by
  the Rust core (`spark-connect` / `-core` / `-proto`), so a reference-private or
  generated symbol is not mirrored one-to-one.

The ledger is a development tracking tool (kept under `dev/parity/`); the official
test suite is the authoritative gate.

## What "drop-in" means

From Python, `pyspark-client-rust` replaces the `pyspark-client` package: same
`import pyspark`, same public API, same server - see [Installation](installation.md).
Use it exactly like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/).
The native [Rust API](dataframes.md) mirrors the same surface.
