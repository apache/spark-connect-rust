# Known behavior differences from PySpark Connect

Behaviors of the Rust-backed Python client that differ from PySpark Connect 4.3.0, kept
here so that a version upgrade does not rediscover them. Each entry says whether the
difference is intentional or tracked for a fix.

## `createDataFrame`

- **A pandas DataFrame with a StructType of another width** (intentional, SPARK-60902).
  PySpark's pandas conversion zips the DataFrame's columns with the schema's fields. With
  fewer fields than columns it silently drops the extra columns, and with more fields it
  raises PyArrow's `ArrowInvalid`. This client raises `AXIS_LENGTH_MISMATCH` for both
  rather than drop data.
- **NumPy ndarray input** (tracked by SPARK-60772). Not accepted yet.
